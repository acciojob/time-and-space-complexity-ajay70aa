	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. It is often represented using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe how memory requirements grow.</p>
